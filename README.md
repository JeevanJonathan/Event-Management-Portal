# Event-Management-Portal
Hi. This is a full stack web application built using React + Spring Boot. This is my final year Project. 

This app provides users to select vendors for their events and book them by making payment. Stripe payment gateway is used to make payments. This application provides efficient user experience. The data are temporarily stored in the redux every time the user logs in so that the user can access the data quickly.
